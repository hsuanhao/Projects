# Study Whether Housing Prices Are Effected By Recessions


**Hypothesis**: University towns have their mean housing prices less effected by recessions compared to non-university towns. I applied a t-test to compare the ratio of the mean price of houses in university towns the quarter before the recession starts compared to the recession bottom. (`price_ratio=quarter_before_recession/recession_bottom`)


**Definitions:**
* A _quarter_ is a specific three month period, Q1 is January through March, Q2 is April through June, Q3 is July through September, Q4 is October through December.
* A _recession_ is defined as starting with two consecutive quarters of GDP decline, and ending with two consecutive quarters of GDP growth.
* A _recession bottom_ is the quarter within a recession which had the lowest GDP.
* A _university town_ is a city which has a high percentage of university students compared to the total population of the city.
