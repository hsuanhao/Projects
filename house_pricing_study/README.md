# Study Whether Housing Prices Are Effected By Recessions


**Hypothesis**: University towns have their mean housing prices less effected by recessions compared to non-university towns. I applied a **t-test** to compare the ratio of the mean price of houses in university towns the quarter before the recession starts compared to the recession bottom as shown in [Study_house_pricing.ipynb](https://github.com/hsuanhao/Projects/blob/master/house_pricing_study/Study_house_pricing.ipynb). (`price_ratio=quarter_before_recession/recession_bottom`)


**Definitions:**
* A _quarter_ is a specific three month period, Q1 is January through March, Q2 is April through June, Q3 is July through September, Q4 is October through December.
* A _recession_ is defined as starting with two consecutive quarters of GDP decline, and ending with two consecutive quarters of GDP growth.
* A _recession bottom_ is the quarter within a recession which had the lowest GDP.
* A _university town_ is a city which has a high percentage of university students compared to the total population of the city.

## Data Sources:
For this project, we will use 3 data sources:
1. From the Wikipedia page on college towns is a list of [university towns in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_college_towns#College_towns_in_the_United_States) which has been copy and pasted into the file ```university_towns.txt```.
2. From Bureau of Economic Analysis, US Department of Commerce, the [GDP over time](http://www.bea.gov/national/index.htm#gdp) of the United States in current dollars (use the chained value in 2009 dollars), in quarterly intervals, in the file ```gdplev.xls```. For this assignment, only look at GDP data from the first quarter of 2000 onward.
3. From the [Zillow research data site](http://www.zillow.com/research/data/) there is housing data for the United States. In particular the datafile for [all homes at a city level](http://files.zillowstatic.com/research/public/City/City_Zhvi_AllHomes.csv), ```City_Zhvi_AllHomes.csv```, has median home sale prices at a fine grained level.
