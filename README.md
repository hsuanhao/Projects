# Selected Projects

In this repository, I put selected data analysis projects I have done for real-world data by using different **machine learning** or **deep learning models** as well as **hypothesis testing**. 

To complete each project, I mainly use **R**, **MySQL**, or **Python**, and some useful libraries in Python, such as **NumPy** (for vectorization calculation), **Pandas** (for data manipulation and analysis), **SciPy** (for scientific computing), **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** (for visualization), **nltk** (for natural language processing), and **sckit-learn** (for machine learning). In addition, I implemented a learning algorithm "from scratch" by using a **Tensorflow** framework and coded them in **object oriented programming**.
