# Selected Projects

In this repository, I put selected data analysis projects I have done for real-world data by using different **machine learning** or **deep learning models** as well as **hypothesis testing** to test statistical significance. 

To complete each project, I mainly use **R**, **MySQL**, or **Python**, and some useful libraries in Python, such as **NumPy** (a library for working with arrays of data), **Pandas** (a library for providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools), **SciPy** (a library of techniques for numerical and scientific computing), **Matplotlib** (a library for making graphs) and **Seaborn** (a higher-level interface to Matplotlib that can be used to simplify many graphing tasks), **Statsmodels** (a library that implements many statistical techniques), **nltk** (for natural language processing), and **sckit-learn** (for machine learning). In addition, I implemented a learning algorithm "from scratch" by using a **Tensorflow** framework and coded them in **object oriented programming**.
