# Projects

In this repository, I put data analysis projects I have done for real-world data by using different statistical models and algorithms in **machine learning** or **deep learning**. 

To complete each project, I mainly use **Python**, **MySQL**, and some useful libraries, such as **NumPy** (for vectorization calculation), **Pandas** (for data manipulation and analysis), **SciPy** (for scientific computing), **Matplotlib** (for plotting), **nltk** (for natural language processing), and **sckit-learn** (for machine learning). In addition, I implemented a learning algorithm "from scratch" by using a **Tensorflow** framework and coded them in **object oriented programming**.


- [Predicting sentiment from product reviews](https://github.com/hsuanhao/Projects/tree/master/Predicting%20sentiment%20from%20product%20reviews) (plan to do)
- [Predicting house pricing in Seattle](https://github.com/hsuanhao/Projects/tree/master/Predicting%20house%20pricing%20in%20Seattle) (**Regression**, **Tensorflow**, **Object Oriented Programming**, **Python**) (ongoing)
- [Studying Test Relationships from Dognition Database](https://github.com/hsuanhao/Projects/tree/master/Studying%20Test%20Relationships%20from%20Dognition%20Database) (**Queries by MySQL**) 
- [Spelling Recommender](https://github.com/hsuanhao/Projects/tree/master/Spelling_Recommender) (**Natural Language Processing**, **Python**)
- [Predicting the propensity to pay renewal premium and building an incentive plan for its agents to maximise the net revenue (McKinsey Analytics Online Hackathon)](https://github.com/hsuanhao/Projects/tree/master/Predicting%20the%20propensity%20to%20pay%20renewal%20premium) (**Binary Classification**, **sckit-learn**, **Python**)
