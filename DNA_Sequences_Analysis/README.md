# DNA Sequences Analysis

1. [DNA Sequence Process](https://github.com/hsuanhao/Projects/blob/master/DNA_Sequences_Analysis/DNA_Sequences_Process.ipynb): Wrote a Python program that takes as input a file containing DNA sequences in multi-FASTA format, and made queries to find all possible open reading frames (ORFs) with given DNA sequences. [dnautil.py](https://github.com/hsuanhao/Projects/blob/master/DNA_Sequences_Analysis/dnautil.py) is the module collecting useful functions to process DNA sequence.
