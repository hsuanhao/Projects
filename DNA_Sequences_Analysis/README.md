# DNA Sequences Analysis

1. [DNA Sequence Process](https://github.com/hsuanhao/Projects/blob/master/DNA_Sequences_Analysis/DNA_Sequences_Process.ipynb): Wrote a Python program that takes as input a file containing DNA sequences in multi-FASTA format, and made queries to **find all possible open reading frames (ORFs) with given DNA sequences**. [dnautil.py](https://github.com/hsuanhao/Projects/blob/master/DNA_Sequences_Analysis/dnautil.py) is the module collecting useful functions to process DNA sequence.

2. [naive_with_rc.ipynb](https://github.com/hsuanhao/Projects/blob/master/DNA_Sequences_Analysis/naive_with_rc.ipynb): Implemented the **strand-aware naive exact matching algorithm**, coded as function `naive_with_rc` in module `dnautil`, for DNA sequences alignment.
